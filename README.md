# 52-weeks
I have taken a [challenge to learn a new technology every week in 2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016).
The goal is to learn a new technology and build a simple application using it.

Massive thanks to @shekhargulati for this brilliant idea and all the effort he has put in to the project.
